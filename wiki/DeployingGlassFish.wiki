#labels Phase-Deploy
#Building and deploying the Nabla Application on GlassFish.

= Introduction =

It is assumed here that you already have a running [http://glassfish.java.dev.net Glassfish] instance. While developing we used version 2.1 so it is garantueed to work with that version.

  # Checkout the code from the repository  
  # run 'mvn clean install'
  # start database
    * goto $J2EE_HOME/javadb/bin
    * run 'startNetworkServer.bat' 
  # goto the checkout directory again
  # goto the setup directory
  # run 'setup.bat'
  # goto apps directory
  # run mvn clean install
  # run mvn glassfish:deploy
  # Open webbrowser and goto http://localhost:8090/ab

That should be it to run and deploy the application. For all the steps taken this is the same. (Check the branches in subversion to checkout a certain step).
