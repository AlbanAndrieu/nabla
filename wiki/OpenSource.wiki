#What is open source.

= Definition =

This is what I call open source :
Code under this project can be use by any one, as soon as that person contribute to the project ;-).

= Warning =

I have not checked that every dependencies are open source. But it should be, as I did this project myself or found everything on the net.

= Your right =

If any code or dependency is not "free", delete it!!! (Or ask me to do so)
